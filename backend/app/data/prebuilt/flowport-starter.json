      "content": "Flowport is an inference and retrieval orchestration gateway that connects Flowtomic applications to any hosted model on Hugging Face. It combines API gateway patterns with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) workflows so teams can bring their existing knowledge into new GenAI products without rebuilding infrastructure.",

      "content": "Flowport focuses on three pillars: easy model connectivity, flexible augmentation, and production safety. Any Hugging Face model can be invoked through a simple API that understands Flowtomic credentials. Augmentation can pull from ad-hoc files, curated knowledge bases, or automatically built document collections. Observability, throttling, and auditing are built in to help teams ship production-ready experiences quickly.",

Flowport normalizes each source into rich semantic chunks that are ready for retrieval at inference time.",

      "content": "Flowport pairs naturally with Flowknow. Teams curate files and briefs inside Flowknow, which automatically builds the vector indexes that Flowport references by knowledge_base_id. This default knowledge pack includes highlights from both products so you can attach it to any model and immediately demonstrate retrieval-augmented answers about the Flowtomic stack.",
